Backend application that allows for insertion, filtering and deletion of snippets.

This is a project that I develop while following along the [Let's Go](#https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) book from Alex Edwards and Mario Carrion's ["ToDo API" Microservice Example](#https://github.com/MarioCarrion/todo-api-microservice-example).

Missing parts:
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Rate Limiting
- [ ] Generating a docker image
- [ ] Deploying the service locally with kubernetes
- [ ] Basic frontend app
- [x] JWT Authentication
- [x] Middlewares
- [x] Inversion of control
